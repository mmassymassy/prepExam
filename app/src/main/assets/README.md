# Countries and territories of the world (some useful data)

This repository contains some data about countries of the world:
- A JSON file with the countries and territories (ISO code, name and coordinates of the geographical center)
- A directory containing flags (in PNG format)
- A directory with rankings of the countries using different criteria; those data are extracted from the [CIA World Factbook](https://github.com/factbook/factbook.json).
